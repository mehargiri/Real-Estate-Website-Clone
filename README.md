## Overview

### The challenge

This website is a clone of a local real estate website. The actual website is dynamic with house listings that can be updated by the user. However, I recreated the website to practice my vanilla JavaScript and CSS skills. Therefore, this clone website is static with interactive elements such as back to the top button and an accordion-like sub menu.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Since this was the first time I decided to recreate a large website while I was studying JavaScript and CSS, I had some difficulty understanding how CSS properties and JavasScript's DOM works. With the completion of this project, my understanding of CSS properties and the DOM tree greatly improved.

### Continued development

I hope to create a dynamic real estate website in future where users can view multiple listings in different pages as well as filter listings according to price, and location.

### How to use

Since this is a vanilla Javascript with plain CSS project, there is no need to install additional packages. You can directly open the html file in the browser.
